# Emojo Dumper

Emojo Dumper is a tool to dump emojis from Mastodon instances. Do not use this tool too often or you will get restricted by things like Cloudflare.

## Usage

You will need Python 3. No additional dependencies required.

Then change the API endpoint in the `r` variable and run the `dump.py` file. If you let everything as it is every emoji is getting dumped from koyu.space which has the biggest emoji collection so far. It will also download stickers for instances which support it.
